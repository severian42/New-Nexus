- Calculation
  - Calculator
- Web Requests

  - StableDiffusion plugin requires R2 storage configuration, please refer to the Cloudflare R2 service configuration guide for setup.
- Arxiv

**Development Plans**
- Support DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.
- When SERPAPI_API_KEY is configured, SerpAPI is used as the search plugin by default. If not configured, DuckDuckGo is used by default.
- When BING_SEARCH_API_KEY is configured, BingSerpAPI is used as the search plugin by default. If not configured, DuckDuckGo is used by default.
- Priority: SerpAPI > BingSerpAPI > DuckDuckGo
- Development of the plugin list page.
- Support for toggling specific plugins.
- Support for adding custom plugins.
- Support for Agent parameter configuration (agentType, maxIterations, returnIntermediateSteps, etc.).
- Support for ChatSession level plugin functionality toggle.
- Plugin toggle appears only when using models other than 0301 and 0314; other models default to closed status, and the toggle will not display.

**Known Issues**
- When using plugins, you need to switch to the 0613 version model, such as gpt-3.5-turbo-0613.
- Attempts to use agents like chat-conversational-react-description with plugins are not ideal, and support for other versions of the model is no longer considered.
- Limitations modified so that models other than 0301 and 0314 can call plugins. #10
- SERPAPI_API_KEY is currently required, but support for using DuckDuckGo to replace the search plugin will be added later.
- Agent does not support custom interface addresses.
- Plugins may fail in some scenarios.
- Issue occurs due to parameter errors when using the Calculator for calculations, currently unable to intervene.
- No feedback after plugin call failure.

After configuring the password, users need to manually fill in the access code on the settings page to chat normally, otherwise, they will be prompted with an unauthorized status message.
Warning: Please set the password long enough, preferably more than 7 characters, to prevent brute force attacks.
This project provides limited permission control functionality, please add an environment variable named CODE on the Vercel project control panel's environment variable page, with values separated by English commas for custom passwords:
- code1,code2,code3
After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project to make the changes take effect.

**Deployment**
Container Deployment (Recommended)
Docker version needs to be 20 or above, otherwise, it will prompt that the image is not found.
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The docker version will most of the time lag behind the latest version by 1 to 2 days, so there will be continuous prompts for "updates available", which is normal.

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxx" \
   -e CODE="page access password" \
   gosuto/chatgpt-next-web-langchain
You can also specify a proxy:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxx" \
   -e CODE="page access password" \
   --net=host \
   -e PROXY_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7890" \
   gosuto/chatgpt-next-web-langchain
If your local proxy requires a username and password, use:

-e PROXY_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7890 user password"
If you need to specify other environment variables, please add -e environment variable=environment variable value to the above command.
